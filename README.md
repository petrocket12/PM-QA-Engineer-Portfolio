## <a name="aboutme">:mag_right: ABOUT ME</a>

I am a dedicated **QA Engineer** with over 2 years of professional experience in **manual testing** and 7 months in **test automation**. My expertise is focused on **financial applications**, including projects related to funds, investments, and CRM systems.  

I have contributed to the success of multiple **regression testing cycles**, where I delivered high-quality test planning, execution, and reporting. With **daily English communication**, I have effectively collaborated with international teams. Additionally, my automation work has included maintaining and enhancing automated scripts, refactoring under tight deadlines, and implementing solutions to optimize test processes.  

Currently, I am advancing my skills as an **SDET (Java)** while exploring modern tools and frameworks to optimize quality assurance practices.
